# Self-Financing Smart Buildings
*MSc Engineering Management for Sustainable Value*

## Overview
This project explores how universities can reduce emissions and operating costs by implementing smart building technologies and self-financing models.

## Problem
University buildings contribute significantly to energy use and carbon emissions, with rising gas/electricity consumption and upcoming regulatory pressures (e.g., Energy Performance of Buildings Directive).

## Solution Approach
- Introduce smart building systems (HVAC control, lighting automation, monitoring, digital twins).
- Refurbish older buildings to improve efficiency and user experience.
- Integrate sustainability-driven design and campus “living labs” for students.

## Key Insights
- Potential **25% reduction** in energy, water, and emissions.
- Smart buildings improve occupant wellbeing and operational safety.
- Zero-upfront-cost pathways possible through financing mechanisms.

## Financing Methods
- Smart Building as a Service (SBaaS)
- Sustainability bonds
- Revenue generation + cost savings incentives

## Outcome
A strategic roadmap enabling universities to upgrade infrastructure sustainably while enhancing reputation and creating hands-on learning opportunities for students.
