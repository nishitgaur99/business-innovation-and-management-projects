# Commercialisation of New Technology – Fashion Social Commerce Strategy  
*Commercialisation of New Technology*

## Overview  
This project develops a commercialisation strategy for a proposed fashion social-commerce platform offering personalised styling, influencer-driven recommendations, and streamlined online shopping. The analysis explores value proposition design, customer targeting, competitor benchmarking, and revenue model development.

## Problem  
Customers increasingly demand personalised and efficient online fashion experiences, yet existing platforms often overwhelm users with choice and lack tailored recommendations. At the same time, new fashion-tech ventures face intense competition from established e-commerce brands, requiring a clear differentiation strategy and sustainable commercial model.

## Analysis Approach  
- Analysed the platform’s **value proposition**, focusing on algorithm based personalisation, influencer engagement, and convenience (pages 3–6).  
- Designed a **Business Model Canvas** covering key partners, channels, cost structure, and revenue streams (page 6).  
- Conducted a **competitor analysis** including market scanning, online presence evaluation, and a SWOT comparison across five major UK fashion platforms (pages 7–9).  
- Developed a **differentiation strategy** using personalisation features, gamification, stylist interactions, and social commerce tools (pages 10–12).  
- Explored opportunities for **strategic partnerships** with logistics providers and e-commerce leaders to expand reach and improve customer experience.

## Key Insights  
- Algorithm-driven personalisation is a major competitive differentiator, especially when expanded with body type, skin tone, and occasion-based recommendations.  
- Social commerce features such as influencer content, style-coach communities, and gamified challenges significantly improve customer engagement and retention.  
- Partnerships with major e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon) strengthen logistics, broaden market reach, and support scalable growth.  
- Competitor benchmarking shows opportunities to stand out through customisation depth, user interaction, and integrated social shopping experiences.

## Strategic Recommendation  
Prioritise a customer-centric commercialisation strategy that combines deep personalisation, influencer-led engagement, and seamless purchasing journeys. Strengthen the business model through subscription offerings, commission-based revenue, logistics partnerships, and extended social commerce integration.

## Outcome  
The project demonstrates how structured commercialisation tools—value proposition design, competitor analysis, business model development, and differentiation strategy—can be applied to launch a new fashion-tech venture. The recommended pathway positions the platform for growth in a competitive and rapidly evolving digital retail landscape.
