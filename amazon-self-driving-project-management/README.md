# Project & Change Management – Amazon Self-Driving Vehicle Development  
*Project and Change Management*

## Overview
This project applies project management and change management techniques to Amazon’s development of self-driving vehicles after the acquisition of Zoox. It evaluates the project charter, stakeholder dynamics, and the organisational change implications of deploying autonomous delivery and ride-hailing services.

## Problem
Developing autonomous vehicles introduces complexity across software, sensors, safety, regulatory compliance, and stakeholder resistance. Coordinating cross-functional teams while integrating AI, LIDAR, GPS, and real-time data systems poses significant challenges for project planning and delivery.

## Analysis Approach
- Reviewed Amazon–Zoox project charter components, objectives, milestones, and assumptions (pages 6–8).  
- Assessed change management challenges related to culture, policy, safety, and societal impact.  
- Mapped key stakeholders using a power–interest matrix and evaluated their influence on project outcomes (pages 10–12).  
- Examined communication requirements and project governance considerations.

## Key Insights
- Autonomous vehicle development complexity demands strong project governance, documentation, and risk planning.  
- Stakeholders such as legislators, software providers, ENGOs, and end users hold high influence over project success.  
- Change management is essential due to safety concerns, workforce disruption, regulatory uncertainty, and public trust issues.

## Strategic Recommendation
Strengthen early-stage project governance by enhancing stakeholder planning, refining charter clarity, and establishing robust communication channels. This increases alignment across technical, regulatory, and user-centric elements of the autonomous vehicle strategy.

## Outcome
The analysis highlights how structured project and change management tools can support Amazon in delivering a safe, scalable, and regulated autonomous vehicle ecosystem while navigating complex stakeholder expectations.
