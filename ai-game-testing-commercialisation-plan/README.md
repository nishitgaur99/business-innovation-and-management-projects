# Commercialisation of New Technology – AI Game Testing Platform  
*Commercialisation of New Technology*

## Overview  
This project develops a commercialisation strategy for an AI-powered game-testing platform that uses facial emotion recognition to provide more accurate gameplay feedback. The analysis covers customer needs, value proposition design, market sizing, partnerships, and long-term business model development.

## Problem  
Independent and small-scale game developers often lack access to structured, unbiased play-testing due to high costs and limited technical capability. Existing testing communities provide inconsistent feedback, and developers need more reliable, data-driven insights to improve player experience. Gamers also lack incentives to participate in formalised testing.

## Analysis Approach  
- Defined customer segments and mapped problems for gamers and developers (slides 3–5).  
- Designed a platform concept combining AI emotion analytics with reward-based user engagement.  
- Conducted **market sizing** using TAM, SAM, and SOM for both game developers and gamers (slides 8, 16–18).  
- Assessed the revenue model (freemium + developer charges) and cost structure (servers, software, maintenance).  
- Evaluated the intellectual property landscape including software copyright, trademark opportunities, and open-source AI dependencies (slide 9).  
- Identified partnership opportunities, new markets, and competitive differentiation.

## Key Insights  
- Demand for structured game-testing services is growing alongside a rapidly expanding indie games market.  
- Gamers respond strongly to reward-based engagement models, increasing participation and testing volume.  
- Developers benefit from emotion-recognition insights, improving game design and player satisfaction.  
- Commercial viability is strengthened by open-source AI tools and scalable cloud-based infrastructure.

## Strategic Recommendation  
Adopt a **freemium platform model**, offering free access for gamers and tiered pricing for developers. Build early traction through partnerships with influencer communities, game engines, and distribution platforms (e.g., Steam extensions). Expand into adjacent markets such as mobile game testing and video content analytics.

## Outcome  
The project demonstrates a full commercialisation pathway for a new AI-driven technology, integrating customer discovery, market analysis, IP assessment, and monetisation strategy. The proposed approach positions the platform for scalable adoption across the global game-testing ecosystem.
