# Creativity & Innovation Strategy – SCAMPER Analysis  
*Creativity for Innovation*

## Overview  
This project applies the SCAMPER creative thinking framework to generate, assess, and refine strategic innovation ideas for a local SME in the cycling retail sector. The aim was to explore opportunities to enhance marketing, customer engagement, and service offerings through structured creativity techniques.

## Problem  
Small retail businesses in competitive markets need innovative ways to differentiate themselves and attract new customer segments. The challenge addressed in this project was identifying practical, high-impact innovation opportunities that could strengthen visibility, improve services, and create new value for customers.

## Analysis Approach  
- Applied the **SCAMPER framework** (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse) to generate a wide range of creative ideas (pages 2–6).  
- Evaluated ideas using a **weighted scoring tool** focused on feasibility, technical considerations, market effectiveness, and potential environmental/social impact (page 6).  
- Selected the three highest-scoring ideas for deeper implementation analysis.

## Key Insights  
- Digital innovation opportunities emerged across marketing, e-commerce, and customer experience.  
- Partnerships and service bundling can create competitive advantages and add value for niche user groups such as students and tourists.  
- Repurposing existing assets (e.g., refurbished bikes) opens new revenue channels while supporting sustainability goals.

## Strategic Recommendation  
Prioritise solutions that offer both customer value and operational scalability, such as digital engagement tools, community-focused initiatives, and service innovations. These strategies demonstrated the highest combined impact across feasibility, customer reach, and long-term business differentiation.

## Outcome  
This project demonstrates the application of structured creativity methods to develop actionable innovation strategies. The SCAMPER and scoring tools enabled evidence-based selection of ideas with strong potential to improve visibility, broaden customer reach, and support sustainable growth for a small retail business.
