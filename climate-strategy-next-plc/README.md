# Climate Strategy Analysis – NEXT Plc
*Engineering Management for Sustainable Value*

## Overview
This project evaluates NEXT Plc’s carbon footprint and sustainability performance across Scopes 1, 2, and 3, identifying key challenges and strategic opportunities for decarbonisation.

## Problem
NEXT’s emissions have increased since 2021, with the **majority coming from Scope 3**, particularly purchased goods, product use, and logistics. Limited supply chain transparency further restricts accurate measurement and reduction of emissions.

## Analysis Approach
- Assessed global carbon footprint trends using Scope 1–3 emissions data (pages 4–6).  
- Evaluated progress against NEXT’s sustainability targets (waste diversion, emissions reduction).  
- Conducted a SWOT analysis on the company’s sustainability strategy.  
- Reviewed alignment with SBTi and Dunphy’s sustainability engagement model (page 21).

## Key Insights
- NEXT has strong ESG governance and science-based targets but struggles with **Scope 3 reductions**, achieving only **12% progress** toward a 40% goal.  
- Transparency gaps persist beyond Tier 3 suppliers, limiting traceability.  
- Water usage and raw material dependency pose additional risks.

## Strategic Recommendation
Implement **blockchain-based supply chain traceability** to improve visibility across all tiers, track real-time emissions, and support more accurate sustainability reporting. Case examples highlight how digital provenance can enhance transparency and circularity.

## Outcome
This analysis provides a pathway for NEXT to strengthen sustainability performance, prioritise Scope 3 reductions, and adopt emerging technologies to transition toward more responsible and transparent supply.
