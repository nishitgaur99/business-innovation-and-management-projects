# Strategic Engineering Management Analysis  
*Management Practices for Engineering*

## Overview  
This project applies strategic analysis and decision-making frameworks to evaluate the performance of a hypothetical engineering firm operating in the food packaging sector. The analysis identifies declining market share, rising competitive pressure, and segment-specific challenges, leading to the development of actionable strategies to improve revenue, profitability, and long-term market positioning. 

## Problem  
The company is losing market share across multiple product segments despite operating in a growing industry. Competitor expansion, technological advancement, declining customer numbers, and cost pressures contribute to revenue erosion. The challenge was to determine how the organisation could regain competitiveness and return to profitable growth.

## Analysis Approach  
- Conducted **market share, competitor, and trend analysis** across consumables, equipment, and MRO/consultancy divisions.  
- Evaluated **financial performance**, including margins, profitability drivers, and segment-level contributions.  
- Developed **strategic action plans** for each business unit to address declining performance and capture new opportunities.  
- Applied **scenario planning** to test the robustness of strategies under different future market conditions.

## Key Insights  
- The consumables division faces the steepest competitive pressure, requiring R&D investment and improved production efficiency.  
- The equipment portfolio lacks competitiveness against market leaders and requires repositioning, cost reduction, and new product development.  
- MRO and consultancy services offer strong growth potential, supported by global expansion and diversification into new industries.  
- Financial improvements depend on optimising SG&A costs and prioritising higher-margin segments.

## Strategic Recommendation  
Pursue a combined strategy of **portfolio restructuring**, **cost optimisation**, and **innovation-driven product development**, supported by global expansion of consultancy services. Strengthen competitive positioning through targeted acquisitions, improved R&D capabilities, and entry into high-growth markets.

## Outcome  
The project demonstrates the use of engineering management frameworks to build actionable strategic plans grounded in market data, financial analysis, and scenario planning. The recommended strategies aim to restore growth, increase profitability, and enhance competitiveness across all business units.
